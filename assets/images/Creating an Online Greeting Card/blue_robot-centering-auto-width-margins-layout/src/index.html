  <hr>
  <em>
Capturing the improvisational energy the band would soon become famous for, WAR’s debut with Animals frontman Eric Burdon burst on the scene and on the charts with the erotic, Latin-tinged hit “Spill The Wine.” For rock icon Burdon it was a dream come true, blending his powerful vocal style with a raw and creative blues band. Standout tracks include “Vision Of Rassan,” “Blues For Memphis Slim,” and the simmering soul revamp of John D. Loudermilk’s blues classic “Tobacco Road.”

  <em>
First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin', I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?" Damn…
</em>
<p>And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
  And I ain't never did this before, no </p>

	<p>This box is horizontally centered by setting its right and left margin widths to "auto". This is the preferred way to accomplish horizontal centering with CSS, and works very well in most browsers with CSS2 support. Unfortunately, IE5/Win does not respond to this method - a shortcoming of that browser, not the technique.</p>
	<p>There is a simple <em>workaround</em>. (A pause while you fight back the nausea induced by that word.) Ready? IE5/Win incorrectly applies the CSS "text-align" attribute to block-level elements. Declaring "text-align:center" for the containing block-level element (often the BODY element) horizontally centers the box in IE5/Win. There is a side effect of this workaround: the CSS "text-align" attribute is inherited, centering inline content. It is often necessary to explicitly set the "text-align" attribute for the centered box, counteracting the effects of the IE5/Win workaround. The relevant CSS follows.</p>
<pre>
body {
	margin:50px 0px; padding:0px;
	text-align:center;
	}
	
#Content {
	width:500px;
	margin:0px auto;
	text-align:left;
	padding:15px;
	border:1px dashed #333;
	background-color:#eee;
